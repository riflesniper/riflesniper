# sprite / he / 23
if you already know who i am and found this profile, uh. yeah there's not much to see here sorry

if you DON'T already know who i am, hi. i'm sprite, and normally i'm a character illustrator who likes to draw robots a lot. why is a gay artist on the code respository website, you may ask? well, i'm currently taking classes in web design as a part of my visual communication program, and i decided that buying up a domain and building my own website would be a great idea. and it is! i also have started delving into making static website templates that people can use for their personal websites.

all of my website stuff is set to private, though. don't want people getting at my `.well-known` files.

you can take a look at the site itself, though! go here ðŸ‘‰ https://riflesniper.art/ for my links, art and other fun stuff. you can also shop my website templates at https://vgen.co/riflesniper/shop :3
